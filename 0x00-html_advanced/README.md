<h2> Tasks </h2>

- To create a definition in HTML, you can use the `<dl>` element for the definition list, `<dt>` for the term, and `<dd>` for the definition. Here's a basic example:

```
<dl>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition for Term 1.</dd>
  <dt>Term 2</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition for Term 2.</dd>
</dl>
```

- The `<blockquote>` element is used to indicate a long quotation. It should contain only block-level elements within it and not just plain text, while `<cite>` element is used to define the title of a work, such as a book, a song, a poem, a painting, or any other creative work, Here's a basic example:

```
<blockquote>
  <p>“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”</p>
  <cite>Edmund Burke</cite>
</blockquote>
```

- The `<q>` tag is used to represent a short inline quotation in HTML. It is typically used to quote a phrase or sentence from another source.
  **PS: `<q>` is suitable for short, inline quotations, while `<blockquote>` is more appropriate for longer quotations (for long or multi-line quotations that are quoted from another source).**

```
<p>As Albert Einstein once said, <q>Imagination is more important than knowledge.</q></p>
```
