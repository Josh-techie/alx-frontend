<h2> Tasks </h2>

- To create a definition in HTML, you can use the <dl> element for the definition list, <dt> for the term, and <dd> for the definition. Here's a basic example:

```
<dl>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition for Term 1.</dd>
  <dt>Term 2</dt>
  <dd>This is the definition for Term 2.</dd>
</dl>
```

- The <blockquote> element is used to indicate a long quotation. It should contain only block-level elements within it and not just plain text, while <cite> element is used to define the title of a work, such as a book, a song, a poem, a painting, or any other creative work, Here's a basic example:

```
<blockquote>
  <p>“The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.”</p>
  <cite>Edmund Burke</cite>
</blockquote>
```
